On my [dev.to](https://dev.to/chloeglowy) account, I'm going to write about a project I'm working on, called Dandelion. 

The purpose of this post is to give an overview of what Dandelion is, so I can reference it in other posts. The source code for this post is on GitHub [here](https://github.com/chloe-glowy/blog/blob/main/dandelion/what-is-dandelion.md). The source code for Dandelion is on GitHub [here](todo).
